I am a financial advisor and investment mentor. I help people understand financial markets, 
including stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. 

MY CORE PRINCIPLES:
‚Ä¢ I find the best information from verifiable and reputable sources
‚Ä¢ I always remind users that capital is at risk
‚Ä¢ I emphasize the need for proper verification before committing to any investment strategy
‚Ä¢ I check my configured AI models and data sources before providing answers
‚Ä¢ I only reply to financial and investment questions - any other prompts are dismissed
‚Ä¢ I am pragmatic, factual, objective, and polite regardless of the conversation tone
‚Ä¢ I base all my arguments on data and analysis

MY APPROACH:
‚Ä¢ For advanced investors: I provide detailed technical analysis and market insights
‚Ä¢ For beginners: I explain concepts clearly and recommend educational resources
‚Ä¢ I always cite my sources (sentiment analysis, technical indicators, news data)
‚Ä¢ If I cannot find relevant information, I honestly say so
‚Ä¢ If I'm not trained to answer something, I clearly state my limitations

MY MANDATE:
Users may ask about market sentiment, specific stocks/crypto, why people invest in certain 
assets, or general investment questions. I always check my models (FinBERT for sentiment, 
technical indicators, news analysis) before answering. I never make guarantees about returns 
and always emphasize risk management and due diligence.

   - Search for the company name
   - The ticker symbol will be shown prominently (usually 1-5 letters)

2. **Google Search** üîé
   - Search: "[Company Name] stock ticker"
   - Google will show the ticker in a stock card at the top

3. **Company Website** üåê
   - Most public companies list their ticker symbol in the investor relations section

**Once you have the ticker, I can help you analyze it!** Just say:
- "Analyze [TICKER]"
- "What do you think about [TICKER]?"
- "Should I invest in [TICKER]?"

**Examples:**
- Apple ‚Üí AAPL
- Microsoft ‚Üí MSFT
- Tesla ‚Üí TSLA
- Amazon ‚Üí AMZN
- Google ‚Üí GOOGL

**Dividends** are cash payments that companies make to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, as a way to distribute profits.

### How Dividends Work:
- **Declaration**: Company's board announces dividend amount per share
- **Ex-Dividend Date**: Buy before this date to receive the dividend
- **Payment Date**: Money hits your brokerage account

### Types of Dividends:
1. **Cash Dividends** - Direct payment (most common)
2. **Stock Dividends** - Additional shares instead of cash
3. **Special Dividends** - One-time payments from excess profits

### Key Metrics:
- **Dividend Yield** = (Annual Dividend / Stock Price) √ó 100%
  - Example: $4/year dividend, $100 stock price = 4% yield
- **Payout Ratio** = (Dividends / Earnings) √ó 100%
  - Lower ratio = more sustainable

### Investment Strategy:
‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Passive income stream
- Sign of financial health
- Historically less volatile stocks

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:**
- Not guaranteed (can be cut)
- Taxed as income
- May limit growth potential

### Dividend Champions:
Companies with 25+ years of consistent dividend increases:
- Consumer Staples: Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO)
- Industrials: 3M (MMM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
- Utilities: Many electric/water companies

It tells you how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of the company's earnings.

### Example:
- Stock price: $100
- EPS: $5
- P/E Ratio: 100 √∑ 5 = **20**

This means investors pay $20 for every $1 of earnings.

### Interpretation:
**High P/E (>25):**
- ‚úÖ Investors expect strong future growth
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May be overvalued if growth doesn't materialize
- Common in: Technology, biotech, growth stocks

**Low P/E (<15):**
- ‚úÖ Potentially undervalued bargain
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May indicate declining business or sector challenges
- Common in: Mature industries, value stocks

**Average P/E (~15-20):**
- Market average (S&P 500 historically ~15-18)
- Fair valuation based on current earnings

### Types of P/E:
1. **Trailing P/E**: Based on past 12 months earnings (most common)
2. **Forward P/E**: Based on estimated future earnings
3. **Shiller P/E (CAPE)**: 10-year inflation-adjusted average

### Using P/E Effectively:
‚úÖ **Do**: Compare within the same industry
‚úÖ **Do**: Look at historical P/E trends
‚úÖ **Do**: Consider growth rate (PEG Ratio = P/E √∑ Growth Rate)

‚ùå **Don't**: Compare across different sectors
‚ùå **Don't**: Rely on P/E alone
‚ùå **Don't**: Ignore negative earnings (P/E undefined)

- **Tech Giants**: Often 25-35 P/E (growth expectations)
- **Banks**: Typically 10-15 P/E (mature, cyclical)
- **Utilities**: Usually 15-20 P/E (stable, regulated)

**RSI** is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes. It ranges from 0 to 100.

### How to Read RSI:

**üî¥ Overbought Zone (RSI > 70)**
- Price may have risen too fast
- Potential reversal or pullback coming
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Don't short just because RSI > 70!

**üü¢ Oversold Zone (RSI < 30)**
- Price may have fallen too fast
- Potential bounce or recovery coming
- ‚úÖ Opportunity: But confirm with other indicators!

**üîµ Neutral Zone (30-70)**
- Normal trading range
- No extreme conditions

### Calculation (Simplified):
RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + (Average Gain / Average Loss))]
- Default period: 14 days
- Based on closing prices

### Trading Strategies:

**1. Basic Overbought/Oversold**
- Sell when RSI > 70 (overbought)
- Buy when RSI < 30 (oversold)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Works best in ranging markets, not strong trends!

**2. Divergence (Advanced)**
- **Bullish Divergence**: Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low ‚Üí Potential reversal up
- **Bearish Divergence**: Price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high ‚Üí Potential reversal down

**3. Centerline Crossover**
- RSI crosses above 50 ‚Üí Bullish momentum
- RSI crosses below 50 ‚Üí Bearish momentum

### Important Caveats:
‚ö†Ô∏è **In Strong Uptrends**: RSI can stay above 70 for weeks!
‚ö†Ô∏è **In Strong Downtrends**: RSI can stay below 30 for weeks!
‚ö†Ô∏è **Use with Other Indicators**: RSI + MACD + Volume = Better decisions

### Timeframes:
- **Short-term traders**: 9 or 14-day RSI
- **Swing traders**: 14 or 21-day RSI
- **Long-term investors**: 25 or 30-day RSI

### Example Stocks:
- Strong uptrend (Tesla 2020): RSI stayed 60-80 for months
- Bear market (2022): Many stocks had RSI 20-40 for months

**MACD** is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.

### Components:

**1. MACD Line** (Blue line typically)
- 12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA
- Shows momentum direction and strength

**2. Signal Line** (Red/Orange line)
- 9-day EMA of the MACD line
- Acts as trigger for buy/sell signals

**3. Histogram** (Bars)
- MACD Line minus Signal Line
- Visual representation of momentum strength

### Trading Signals:

- MACD crosses above zero line ‚Üí Uptrend confirmation
- Histogram turns positive and grows ‚Üí Strengthening uptrend

**üî¥ Bearish Signals:**
- MACD line crosses **below** signal line ‚Üí Sell signal
- MACD crosses below zero line ‚Üí Downtrend confirmation
- Histogram turns negative and grows ‚Üí Strengthening downtrend

### Advanced Strategies:

**1. Centerline Crossover**
- MACD above 0 = Bullish regime (use dips to buy)
- MACD below 0 = Bearish regime (use rallies to sell)

**2. Divergence (Most Powerful!)**
- **Bullish**: Price makes lower low, MACD makes higher low
- **Bearish**: Price makes higher high, MACD makes lower high
- Often precedes trend reversals

**3. Histogram Reversal**
- Histogram shrinking = Momentum weakening
- Histogram expanding = Momentum accelerating

### Best Use Cases:
‚úÖ Trending markets (strong directional moves)
‚úÖ Medium to long-term trades (days to weeks)
‚úÖ Confirming breakouts or breakdowns

‚ùå Ranging/choppy markets (many false signals)
‚ùå Very short-term scalping (too slow)

### Timeframes:
- **Default (12, 26, 9)**: Most common for daily charts
- **Faster (5, 13, 5)**: For shorter timeframes
- **Slower (19, 39, 9)**: For longer-term trends

### Real-World Example:
Imagine a stock rallying:
1. MACD crosses above signal ‚Üí Enter long
2. Histogram grows (green bars getting bigger) ‚Üí Add to position
3. MACD stays above zero ‚Üí Hold
4. MACD crosses below signal ‚Üí Exit (take profits)

üí° **Pro Tip**: MACD works best when combined with RSI. MACD for trend direction, RSI for overbought/oversold!

            return """## üéØ Diversification - Don't Put All Eggs in One Basket

**Diversification** is spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk.

### Why Diversify?
- **Reduce Risk**: One bad investment won't sink your portfolio
- **Smoother Returns**: Volatility averages out
- **Capture Different Opportunities**: Some assets rise when others fall

### Dimensions of Diversification:

**1. Asset Classes**
- Stocks (equities)
- Bonds (fixed income)
- Real estate (REITs)
- Commodities (gold, oil)
- Cash/Money market

**2. Geographic**
- US stocks
- International developed (Europe, Japan)
- Emerging markets (China, India, Brazil)

**3. Sectors**
- Technology
- Healthcare
- Financial
- Consumer
- Energy
- Utilities
- (Avoid concentrating in one sector)

**4. Company Size**
- Large-cap (stable, established)
- Mid-cap (growth potential)
- Small-cap (high risk/reward)

**5. Investment Style**
- Growth stocks (high P/E, fast-growing)
- Value stocks (low P/E, undervalued)
- Dividend stocks (income-focused)

### How Much Diversification?

**Minimum Effective Diversification:**
- 15-20 different stocks (reduces company-specific risk)
- 3-5 different sectors
- 2-3 asset classes

**Over-Diversification (Diworsification):**
- 100+ holdings = Too complex to manage
- Returns approach market average
- High fees if using many funds

### Simple Diversification Strategy:

**Conservative Portfolio (Lower Risk):**
- 60% Bonds
- 30% US Stocks (S&P 500 index)
- 10% International Stocks

**Moderate Portfolio (Balanced):**
- 40% Bonds
- 40% US Stocks
- 15% International Stocks
- 5% Real Estate (REIT)

**Aggressive Portfolio (Higher Risk/Reward):**
- 70% US Stocks
- 20% International Stocks
- 10% Bonds or Cash

### Real-World Example:
**2020 COVID Crash:**
- Tech stocks: Rebounded quickly (up 50%+)
- Travel stocks: Crashed hard (down 60%+)
- Gold: Rose (safe haven)
- **Diversified portfolio**: Down 10-20%, recovered faster

**Volatility** measures how much an asset's price fluctuates. High volatility = big price swings (up AND down).

### Measuring Volatility:
- **Standard Deviation**: Statistical measure of price dispersion
- **Beta**: How much stock moves vs. market (Beta 1.0 = moves with market)
- **VIX Index**: "Fear gauge" - measures S&P 500 expected volatility

### Risk Levels by Asset:

**Low Volatility (~5-15% annual swings):**
- Government bonds
- Utilities stocks
- Consumer staples
- Money market funds

**Moderate Volatility (~15-25%):**
- S&P 500 index
- Blue-chip stocks (Apple, Microsoft)
- Investment-grade corporate bonds

**High Volatility (~25-50%):**
- Small-cap stocks
- Growth stocks (unprofitable tech)
- Emerging market stocks
- Commodities (oil, gold)

**Extreme Volatility (50%+ swings possible):**
- ü™ô **Cryptocurrencies** (Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins)
- Penny stocks
- Leveraged ETFs
- Options trading

### Cryptocurrency Volatility:
**Bitcoin Example:**
- 2017: $1,000 ‚Üí $19,000 (1900% gain!) ‚Üí $3,000 (85% crash!)
- 2021: $10,000 ‚Üí $69,000 ‚Üí $15,000
- **Normal**: 20-30% swings in WEEKS

**Why So Volatile?**
- No intrinsic value (speculation-driven)
- Thin liquidity (small trades move price)
- 24/7 trading (no circuit breakers)
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Sentiment-driven (fear/greed extreme)

### Managing Volatility:

**‚úÖ Strategies:**
1. **Position Sizing**: Only risk 1-5% per trade
2. **Diversification**: Mix volatile & stable assets
3. **Long Time Horizon**: Volatility smooths over years
4. **Stop Losses**: Exit if drops X%
5. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Buy regularly (smooth entry price)

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Panic selling during drops
- FOMO buying during rallies
- Over-leveraging (margin trading)
- All-in on one volatile asset

### Your Risk Tolerance:
**Ask yourself:**
- Could you stomach a 50% portfolio drop?
- Do you need this money in <5 years?
- Can you sleep well with high volatility?

**If NO ‚Üí Avoid high-volatility assets**
**If YES ‚Üí Can consider, but still diversify!**

### Volatility ‚â† Risk (Sometimes):
- A stable company's stock can be volatile short-term but low-risk long-term
- A declining company can have low volatility but high risk (slow death)

üí° **Pro Tip**: Volatility creates opportunities for disciplined investors. Buy when others panic, sell when others are greedy!

**Before investing a single dollar:**
1. ‚úÖ **Emergency Fund**: 3-6 months expenses in savings
2. ‚úÖ **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Credit cards (15%+ interest)
3. ‚úÖ **Stable Income**: Consistent cash flow
4. ‚úÖ **Basic Budget**: Know where money goes

**Why?** Stock market can drop 30%+ any year. You need buffer!

### Step 2: Set Clear Goals
**Define your "why":**
- üéØ Retirement (20-40 years away)
- üè† House down payment (5-10 years)
- üéì Kids' education (10-20 years)
- üí∞ Financial independence (10-30 years)

**Time horizon determines strategy:**
- **Long-term (10+ years)**: Can handle volatility ‚Üí Stocks
- **Mid-term (3-10 years)**: Balanced ‚Üí Mix stocks/bonds
- **Short-term (<3 years)**: Preserve capital ‚Üí Bonds/cash

### Step 3: Choose Account Type

**Tax-Advantaged (Use These First!):**
- **401(k)**: Employer retirement (get the match!)
- **IRA**: Individual retirement ($6,500/year limit)
- **Roth IRA**: Tax-free growth (income limits apply)
- **HSA**: Health savings (triple tax advantage!)

**Taxable Brokerage:**
- No contribution limits
- Full flexibility
- Pay capital gains tax

### Step 4: Pick a Broker
**Beginner-Friendly:**
- **Fidelity**: Great research tools
- **Vanguard**: Low-cost index funds
- **Charles Schwab**: Excellent customer service
- **Robinhood**: Simple app (but limited features)

**All are free now** (no commissions on stock trades!)

### Step 5: Start Simple - Index Funds

**For Beginners (Seriously, Start Here):**
- **VTI** - Total US Stock Market
- **VOO** - S&P 500 (Large-cap US)
- **VXUS** - Total International Stock
- **BND** - Total US Bond Market

**One-Fund Solution:**
- **VT** - Total WORLD Stock Market (one fund = 9,000+ stocks!)

**Target-Date Fund:**
- Example: VTTSX (Target 2060)
- Auto-adjusts risk as you age
- Set it and forget it

### Step 6: Determine How Much to Invest

**General Guidelines:**
- **Minimum**: 15% of gross income for retirement
- **Ideal**: 20-30% of income (includes 401k match)
- **Starting Out**: Whatever you can‚Äîeven $50/month!

**Dollar-Cost Averaging:**
- Invest same amount monthly (e.g., $500/month)
- Smooths out market volatility
- Removes emotional timing decisions

### Step 7: Learn as You Go

**First Year Focus:**
- Master the basics (stocks, bonds, diversification)
- Understand fees (expense ratios <0.20% ideal)
- Ignore daily market noise
- **DON'T**: Day trade, buy meme stocks, panic sell

**Recommended Reading (In Order):**
1. **"The Simple Path to Wealth"** - JL Collins (START HERE!)
2. **"The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"** - John Bogle
3. **"The Intelligent Investor"** - Benjamin Graham
4. **"A Random Walk Down Wall Street"** - Burton Malkiel

### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid:

‚ùå **Trying to beat the market** (90% of pros don't!)
‚ùå **Stock picking** (without experience)
‚ùå **Day trading** (95% lose money)
‚ùå **Panic selling in crashes** (lock in losses)
‚ùå **Investing emergency fund money**
‚ùå **Ignoring fees** (2% fee = lose 40% of gains over 30 years!)
‚ùå **Following r/WallStreetBets** (seriously, don't)

### Your First Investment Action Plan:

**This Week:**
1. Open brokerage account (Fidelity/Vanguard/Schwab)
2. Link your bank account
3. Decide monthly contribution amount

**This Month:**
1. Make first investment (VTI or VOO)
2. Set up automatic monthly investments
3. Read "The Simple Path to Wealth"

**This Year:**
1. Max out 401(k) match (if available)
2. Contribute to Roth IRA (if eligible)
3. Stay the course through market volatility

### Golden Rules:
1. üìà **Time in the market > Timing the market**
2. üí∞ **Pay yourself first** (automate investments)
3. üéØ **Stay diversified** (don't put all eggs in one basket)
4. üò¥ **Sleep-well portfolio** (don't take more risk than you can handle)
5. üö´ **Never invest money you need within 3 years**

üí° **Most Important**: START NOW. Even small amounts compound over time. A 25-year-old investing $200/month at 8% return = $700,000 by 65!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember**: Capital is at risk. Markets can drop 50%. Only invest money you won't need for years."""
