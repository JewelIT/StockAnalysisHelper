# AI Chat Assistant Guide

## Overview
The AI Stock Chat Assistant uses DistilBERT Q&A model to answer questions about analyzed stocks. It provides intelligent responses based on the analysis data available.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Stock Selection (Optional)**
- You can select a stock from the dropdown OR
- Mention a ticker in your question (e.g., "What about MSFT?")
- Or ask general questions without selecting a stock

### 2. **Analysis Required**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You must analyze a stock before asking questions about it.
- Use the "Analyze Portfolio" button first
- The chat needs analysis data to answer questions accurately

### 3. **Confidence Scoring**
The AI shows confidence percentage only when:
- ‚úÖ Confidence >= 30%
- ‚úÖ Direct answer found in analysis data
- ‚ùå Hidden for helpful messages and warnings

## ‚ùå **Current Limitations**

### Not Yet Supported:
1. **Currency Conversion**
   - ‚ùå "What's the price in euros?"
   - ‚ùå "Convert to GBP"
   - **Workaround**: Prices shown in USD (or ticker's native currency)
   - **Coming Soon**: Currency conversion feature

2. **Future Predictions**
   - ‚ùå "What will the price be tomorrow?"
   - ‚ùå "Will it go up next week?"
   - **Why**: The AI only analyzes historical data and current indicators

3. **Comparison Between Stocks**
   - ‚ùå "Is MSFT better than AAPL?"
   - ‚ùå "Compare these two stocks"
   - **Workaround**: Ask about each stock separately

4. **Real-Time Data**
   - ‚ùå "What's the price right now?"
   - **Note**: Data is from the most recent analysis (3-month historical)

5. **External Information**
   - ‚ùå "What's the CEO's name?"
   - ‚ùå "When is the earnings report?"
   - **Why**: Only analyzes data from Yahoo Finance/CoinGecko APIs
