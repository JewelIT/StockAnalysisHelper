### Changes Made:

2. **app_chat_endpoint.py** - New enhanced chat endpoint
   - Detects educational questions (priority handling)
   - Offers background vs full analysis option
   - Doesn't auto-trigger portfolio analysis
   - Asks user before displaying results

### Still Need To Do:

3. **app.py** - Replace chat endpoint
   - Copy content from `app_chat_endpoint.py` to replace existing `/chat` route
   
4. **static/js/chat-enhanced.js** - Update for background analysis
   - Handle "needs_confirmation" flag
   - Add background analysis function (silent API call)
   - Don't update main UI for background analysis
   - Only update main screen when user explicitly requests

5. **Frontend improvements**:
   - Make chat messages support markdown links
   - Add "Show full analysis" button when appropriate
   - Better handling of educational responses

## Testing Scenarios:

### Educational Questions (Should NOT trigger analysis):
- "How do I start investing?"
- "What is technical analysis?"
- "How do I manage risk?"
- "What books should I read?"
- "Explain diversification"

**Expected:** Educational response with resources, no analysis

### Stock Questions (Should ask before analyzing):
- "What about AAPL?"
- "Should I invest in TSLA?"

**Expected:** Bot asks "background or full analysis?"

### Background Analysis (Should be silent):
User: "Tell me about MSFT"
Bot: "Background or full?"
User: "Background"

**Expected:** Analysis runs, no UI update, bot answers question

### Full Analysis (Should update UI):
User: "Tell me about MSFT"
Bot: "Background or full?"
User: "Full analysis"

**Expected:** Clear existing tickers, analyze MSFT only, update UI

### Contextual Conversation:
User: "What about AAPL?" ‚Üí Bot analyzes
User: "Is it a good investment?"

**Expected:** Bot remembers AAPL context, provides detailed answer
