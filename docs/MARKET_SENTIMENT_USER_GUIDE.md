## Understanding the Sentiment Logic

The system analyzes:

1. **Market Indices Performance**
   - Are major indices up or down?
   - By how much?
   - How many are positive vs negative?

2. **Sector Rotation**
   - Which sectors are outperforming?
   - Which sectors are underperforming?
   - What does this tell us about market sentiment?

3. **Volatility**
   - Is the VIX elevated (fear) or low (calm)?

Based on these factors, it calculates:
- Overall sentiment direction
- Confidence level
- Actionable stock picks
