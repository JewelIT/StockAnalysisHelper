Code Reorganization Plan
========================

This document outlines the plan to reorganize the src/ folder following SOLID principles
and Python best practices.

## Current Structure Issues

1. All files in flat src/ directory - hard to navigate
2. Missing clear separation of concerns
3. No consistent docstring coverage
4. Difficult to understand dependencies

## New Structure (SOLID-compliant)

### 1. config/ - Configuration & Settings
**Purpose:** Single Responsibility - Handle all configuration
**Files:**
- app_config.py (formerly config.py)
- logging_config.py (stays)

**Principles Applied:**
- Single Responsibility: Only configuration management
- Open/Closed: Easy to extend with new config sources
- Dependency Inversion: Config as interface

### 2. core/ - Core Business Logic
**Purpose:** Domain logic for financial analysis
**Files:**
- sentiment_analyzer.py (enhanced with full docstrings)
- technical_analyzer.py (enhanced with full docstrings)
- portfolio_analyzer.py (enhanced with full docstrings)

**Principles Applied:**
- Single Responsibility: Each handles one analysis type
- Liskov Substitution: Analyzers share common interface
- Interface Segregation: Focused, specific interfaces

### 3. data/ - Data Fetching & Management
**Purpose:** All external data acquisition
**Files:**
- data_fetcher.py (enhanced)
- coingecko_fetcher.py (crypto data)
- social_media_fetcher.py (social data)

**Principles Applied:**
- Single Responsibility: Data fetching only
- Dependency Inversion: Abstract data source interface
- Open/Closed: Easy to add new data sources

### 4. ai/ - AI/ML Components
**Purpose:** Machine learning and AI functionality
**Files:**
- multi_model_sentiment.py (sentiment models)
- stock_chat.py (AI chat interface)
- natural_response_generator.py (NLG)

**Principles Applied:**
- Single Responsibility: AI/ML operations
- Open/Closed: Easy to add new models
- Dependency Inversion: Model interface abstraction

### 5. services/ - Application Services
**Purpose:** Higher-level application services
**Files:**
- analyst_consensus.py (aggregate analyst data)
- chart_generator.py (visualization service)

**Principles Applied:**
- Single Responsibility: Service coordination
- Dependency Inversion: Services depend on abstractions

### 6. utils/ - Utilities
**Purpose:** Helper functions and utilities
**Files:**
- helpers.py (formerly utils.py)

**Principles Applied:**
- Single Responsibility: Reusable utilities only
- Interface Segregation: Small, focused functions

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Create Structure & Move Files
1. Create new directories
2. Move files to appropriate folders
3. Update imports in moved files
4. Create __init__.py for each package

### Phase 2: Add Comprehensive Docstrings
Using Google-style docstrings (Python standard):
```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    \"\"\"
    Brief one-line description.
    
    Longer description if needed, explaining what the function does,
    why it exists, and any important details.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param1 is empty
        TypeError: When param2 is negative
        
    Examples:
        >>> function_name("test", 42)
        True
        
    Note:
        Any additional notes about usage, performance, etc.
    \"\"\"
    pass
```

### Phase 3: Update app.py Imports
Update all imports in app.py to use new structure

### Phase 4: Update Tests
Update test imports to match new structure

### Phase 5: Documentation
Create module-level README files

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability:** Clear structure, easy to find code
2. **Scalability:** Easy to add new features in right place
3. **Testability:** Clear dependencies make testing easier
4. **Onboarding:** New developers understand structure quickly
5. **SOLID Compliance:** Each module has single responsibility

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain compatibility during transition:
- Keep old imports working via __init__.py exports
- Add deprecation warnings
- Update documentation with migration guide

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 hour (structure + moves)
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours (docstrings)
- Phase 3: 30 minutes (app.py updates)
- Phase 4: 30 minutes (test updates)
- Phase 5: 30 minutes (docs)

Total: ~5 hours

## Questions for Product Owner

1. Should we maintain backward compatibility with old imports?
2. Any specific modules you want prioritized for docstrings?
3. Should we create a migration script for external consumers?
