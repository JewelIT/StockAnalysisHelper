# Spec-Kit Coverage Checklist Run

**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Spec**: [/specs/001-spec-kit-coverage/spec.md](specs/001-spec-kit-coverage/spec.md)
**Plan**: [/specs/001-spec-kit-coverage/plan.md](specs/001-spec-kit-coverage/plan.md)
**Status**: Completed per plan

## Checklist Observations

- [x] CHK001: Every Epic and CURRENT_STATE story in `COMPLETE_PROJECT_STATE` has a dedicated Spec-Kit folder/spec so nothing important lives only inside `docs/` or `.archive/`. Evidence: the table enumerates Epic 1‒10 and marks Epics 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 18, 20, and 21 explicitly, while the README's Documentation section links to the corresponding `.specify/features/epic-*/SPEC.md` and plan files. See `.specify/features/COMPLETE_PROJECT_STATE.md#L30` and `README.md#L400-L417`; `CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS` also tracks the Authentication foundation and Phase 2/3 planning that tie back to those epics (`.specify/features/CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS.md#L65-L110`).

- [x] CHK002: The doc-placement policy (Spec-Kit for specs/plans, `docs/` for high-level references only) is documented so future owners know where to publish. Evidence: the Documentation Migration Checklist lays out the policy in the policy section, and the README reiterates that all technical specs live inside `.specify/features/` while `docs/` only keeps MODEL_CREDITS and archives (`.specify/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md#L62-L66`; `README.md#L400-L417`).

- [x] CHK003: The checklist callouts for `CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS` progress (Authentication foundation, payments, coupons, OAuth) and the blocking `CRITICAL_GAPS_ANALYSIS` gaps are present in Spec-Kit so reviewers know which scenarios still need attention. Evidence: `CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS` details the Authentication & Tier System progress and Phase 2/3 planning (`.specify/features/CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS.md#L65-L140`), and `CRITICAL_GAPS_ANALYSIS` enumerates the same blocking gaps (Authentication/Authorization Epic 1 and Test Coverage Epic 3 among others at `.specify/features/CRITICAL_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md#L11-L90`).

- [x] CHK004: Legacy files under `docs/.archive/` are noted as read-only reference material, ensuring no undocumented knowledge slips through. Evidence: the Documentation Migration Checklist identifies `.archive/` as archived reference material and calls out verification steps that expect only `MODEL_CREDITS.md` and `.archive/` remaining in `docs/` (`.specify/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md#L43-L55`).

- [x] CHK005: Non-functional governance (root README pointing to Spec-Kit, README no longer referencing deleted docs, explicit migration checklist guardrail) is spelled out for easy review. Evidence: `README.md#L400-L417` directs readers to Spec-Kit artifacts and states `docs/` now only holds model credits/archives, and `.specify/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md#L43-L58` enumerates the verification steps that enforce the governance.

- [x] CHK006: The documentation migration checklist is the single source of truth for future doc relocations so no scattershot docs reappear. Evidence: the checklist itself declares its purpose/status and lists every migrated/deleted file, plus the policy to keep new technical specs under `.specify/features/` (`.specify/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md#L1-L66`).

- [x] CHK007: Any seeming conflict between the “complete” column in `COMPLETE_PROJECT_STATE` and the “blocking” gaps in `CRITICAL_GAPS_ANALYSIS` is reconciled by the detailed gap descriptions, so readers can trust the published statuses. Evidence: the `COMPLETE_PROJECT_STATE` table shows Epic 1 as “In Progress” (line 30) while `CRITICAL_GAPS_ANALYSIS` immediately drills into the missing authentication pieces (`.specify/features/COMPLETE_PROJECT_STATE.md#L30`; `.specify/features/CRITICAL_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md#L11-L90`).

## Final Status Summary

- All CHK items are satisfied with Spec-Kit artifacts, README guidance, and the Documentation Migration Checklist serving as evidence; no outstanding traceability gaps remain for this run.
- Content path: specs/001-spec-kit-coverage (checklists and spec-kit artifacts under this directory remain the source for future updates).
- Next step suggestion: Re-run this checklist after any further epic delivery so the checklist reflects new releases and any remaining docs in `.archive/` or `docs/`.
